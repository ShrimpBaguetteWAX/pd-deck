/*
 * The army that earns the most TLM per hour from the missions on offer, built only from what is
 * staked. Rewards are flat per division and per cycle, so the earning of a division on a mission
 * is the mission's net reward over its cycle, and the cycle is shorter the lower the division's
 * move cost. More divisions earn more, up to the player's allowance and the warlords available.
 *
 * Choosing which missions to field, and with which NFTs, is a packing problem. It is searched
 * division by division: field a division for a mission, take its NFTs out of the pool, repeat.
 * Taking the best-paying next division every time can starve a later one (two 200-ATK divisions
 * may leave nothing for a third, where one 200 and two 100s would earn more), so a beam search
 * keeps the few best partial armies at every step instead of one. Two cheaper greedy passes with
 * other rankings (most per mercenary used; most per stat point used) run as well, and the army
 * that earns the most wins. Each division is the smallest that meets its mission (see
 * planMissionDivision), so the strong units stay for the missions that need them. The divisions
 * that exist now are candidates too, kept as they are, so the answer is never worse than leaving
 * the army alone.
